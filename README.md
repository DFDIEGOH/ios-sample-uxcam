# sample-ios-uxcam

# UXCam integrated sample app for iOS.
This is a sample project demonstrating the use of UXCam SDK for iOS

# SDK Debug Logs

The UXCam SDK has different debug logs that will appear in your XCode terminal as soon as the SDK is running, just like the following: 

** UXCam: Application key is verified, UXCam has started capturing data as per configuration from UXCam settings page.**

In case this is not up and showing, this means that the integration is not the proper one, please contact team@uxcam.com for further assitance

# How to Run it

The only step that you would need to do is to change the app key that is located in the AppDelegate line 24. Please note that the app key can be easily be found in the app settings of your application in the UXCam dashboard.
